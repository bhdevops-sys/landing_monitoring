### landing_monitoring & Landings Profiling For BH

### Landings Monitoring 
Involves tracking long-term trends in fisheries production to understand changes in fish catch over time. 
**Goal** is to capture key data needed to calculate simple length-based indicators of fishery health and 
to track changes in fisheries production, value, and composition. It is conducted daily with fishers and 
buyers at landing sites or buyersâ€™ houses, providing continuous data that reflects patterns in fishing a
ctivity and resource availability.  

### Data Collected
 - Date landed
 - BMU/Landing site
 - Fish trader name
 - Fisher name
 - Fishing Effort (days fishing/gleaning)
 - Species identity (local, common, scientific names)
 - Total weight
 - Total price
 - Reason total catch not sold, if applicable 

 ### Landings Profiling
Landings Profiling complements landing monitoring by gathering more detailed information about fishing activities
and catches. It focuses on understanding the reasons behind observed changes in the monitoring data. 
This is done every one to two years or as needed. Essentially, while monitoring provides consistent, ongoing data, 
profiling provides deeper insights to explain observed trends and changes. The Landings Profiling data is collected 
less frequently and captures information on fishing habitat, gear type, effort, and length of individual fish.
